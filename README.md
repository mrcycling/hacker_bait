# hacker_bait

Got tired of error logs full of 404 notations due to hackers trying to find common WordPress access files and thus drowning out the real errors that we need to be concerned about.  So I created a set of webpage files to match the page names being searched for frequently, filled with a whimsical teapot response.

My logs are cleaner, your mileage may vary.

And don't use these if you use WordPress  ðŸ˜Ž
